CONFIGURATION
================
Configuration files are an easy way to setup clusters so that you do not have to type in long commands in the terminal for setup as that is impractical.

STRUCTURE
===========
All configuration files have 3 major parts:
1. **Metadata**: Contains information about the component. e.g. name
2. **Specification**: Contains informaiton on the configuration needed to be applied to that component.
3. **Status**: This conatains info on the status of the component. It is automatically generated by K8s.
